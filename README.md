Lambert-Solutions
=================

Lambert-Solutions is an open source library of solutions to Lambert's Problem. It is developed for the purpose of providing otherwise unavailable (whether through free scientific literature or code itself) algorithms to be used for any arbitrary purpose related to solving Lambert's problem. The library contains a compendium of well-known solutions -- as well as my own solution -- writeen in both MatLab and C++. 

Dependencies
------------

- MatLab: No external dependencies or MatLab toolboxes are required for any presented algorithms.
- C++   : Requires the use of the 'boost' library available at: https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.78.0/source/

Limitations
-----------

- The provided code is hardly optimized for speed and is meant solely as a representation of the algorithm and its practice. Any and all improvements are tentative    and may be suggested freely. 

Installation
------------

There is no installation required beyond a robust C++ IDE and the MatLab program. For MatLab, go to https://www.mathworks.com/ to purchase a license and download the software if you don't currently have one. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for PC or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for MacOS for a decent C++ compiler. All files provided in the git can be opened and run automatically (provided all necessary requirements have been met for each compiler).
